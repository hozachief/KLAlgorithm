# KLAlgorithm
The implementation of the efficient heuristic KL (Kernighan-Lin) Algorithm as an automated netlist partitioning CAD (computer-aided design) tool. A tool to design modern integrated circuits by partitioning the design into smaller pieces that can be processed with some amount of independence and parallelism. The tool is able to handle large netlists, can redefine a physical hierarchy of an electronic system, and finds high-quality circuit partitioning solutions.
